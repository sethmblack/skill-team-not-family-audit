# Team-Not-Family Audit

Analyze organizational language, policies, and culture for "family thinking" that undermines accountability and performance. Identify where family metaphors create problems and recommend team-oriented alternatives.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for audit output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Recommend terminations without proper process
- Dismiss the value of psychological safety and belonging
- Advise against legitimate family-friendly policies (parental leave, etc.)
- Conflate "team not family" with "cold and uncaring"

**If misused as excuse for harsh treatment:** Clarify that high standards and care are not opposites. Teams can be demanding AND supportive.

---

## When to Use

- Difficulty letting underperformers go
- Guilt or emotional paralysis around performance management
- "We're like a family here" culture causing problems
- New employees getting wrong expectations
- Leadership struggling to maintain high standards
- Post-layoff culture repair

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **culture_description** | Yes | Description of current culture and presenting problem |

## The Team-Not-Family Framework

### Core Distinction (from Tobi Lutke)

"Shopify, like any other for-profit company, is not a family. The very idea is preposterous. You are born into a family. You never choose it, and they can't un-family you."

"The dangers of 'family thinking' are that it becomes incredibly hard to let poor performers go. Shopify is a team, not a family."

"We literally only want the best people in the world."

### Family vs. Team Characteristics

| Aspect | Family | Team |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Membership** | Born into; permanent | Chosen; conditional |
| **Performance** | Unconditional acceptance | Must earn your spot |
| **Exit** | "Un-family" is impossible | People can be cut |
| **Standards** | Love despite failures | High expectations |
| **Growth** | Support regardless | Must grow with the company |
| **Accountability** | Forgive everything | Address underperformance |
| **Loyalty** | Obligatory | Earned through mutual value |

### Warning Signs of Family Thinking

**Language patterns:**
- "We're like a family here"
- "Shopifam" / "[Company]fam" / "work family"
- "We'd never let someone go unless..."
- "Loyalty to the team" (meaning tenure over performance)

**Policy patterns:**
- Inability to terminate long-tenured underperformers
- Promotions based on loyalty over capability
- Tolerance of toxic behavior from "family members"
- Guilt-based retention ("after all we've done for them")

**Behavioral patterns:**
- Managers avoid hard conversations
- HR advises against termination due to "optics"
- Junior employees shocked when anyone leaves
- "That's just how [name] is" excuses

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Audit Current Language

Scan for family metaphors:
- Mission statements
- Values documents
- Onboarding materials
- Leadership communications
- Slack channels and informal language

### Step 2: 2. Identify Problem Patterns

For each instance of family language, ask:
- Is this creating unrealistic expectations?
- Is this preventing necessary accountability?
- Is this causing guilt around legitimate decisions?

### Step 3: 3. Map Consequences

Document how family thinking has manifested:
- Underperformers retained too long
- High performers leaving due to low standards
- Managers paralyzed by guilt
- Junior employees confused by departures

### Step 4: 4. Recommend Team Alternatives

Replace family language with team language:
- "Family" → "Championship team"
- "Loyalty" → "Mutual value"
- "We'd never..." → "We hold high standards because..."
- "Take care of our own" → "Help each other succeed"

### Step 5: 5. Address Cultural Shift

Plan for transition:
- Leadership communication about the change
- Manager training on high-standards conversations
- HR alignment on performance processes
- Explicit discussion with current employees

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Company genuinely has caring culture | Clarify: Care and high standards coexist; audit is about accountability, not warmth |
| Recent layoffs | Acknowledge sensitivity; focus on preventing overcorrection |
| Founder uses family language intentionally | Note the risk; some founders accept the tradeoff |
| Small team (<20) | Family dynamics more natural at small scale; less urgent to change |
| Non-profit or mission-driven organization | Adapt framework; mission can replace family without losing purpose |

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
"We've had the same underperforming engineer for three years. Everyone knows he's not delivering, but our culture is 'we take care of our own.' Managers feel too guilty to address it."

**Output:**

## Team-Not-Family Audit

**Organization:** [Your company]
**Current state:** Family culture with performance consequences
**Risk level:** High

### The Core Problem

You've articulated textbook family thinking:
- "We take care of our own" = unconditional acceptance
- "Managers feel too guilty" = family obligation overriding team standards
- Three years = problem compounded by delay

As Tobi Lutke puts it: "The dangers of 'family thinking' are that it becomes incredibly hard to let poor performers go."

### Problem Patterns Identified

**Accountability gap:**
- Pattern: Known underperformer retained for years
- Evidence: "Everyone knows he's not delivering"
- Impact: High performers see low standards tolerated

**Guilt-based decision making:**
- Pattern: Managers paralyzed by guilt
- Evidence: "Feel too guilty to address it"
- Impact: Managers aren't managing

**Culture of false security:**
- Pattern: Tenure protects from accountability
- Evidence: "We take care of our own"
- Impact: Employees expect unconditional belonging

### Impact Assessment

**On retention:** High performers leave when they see low performers tolerated
**On performance:** Standards erode when underperformance has no consequences
**On culture:** Everyone knows the real rules (tenure > performance)

### Recommended Changes

**Immediate (this week):**
1. Have the conversation with this engineer. Not "you're fired" but "here are expectations, here's the timeline, here's what success looks like."
2. Give managers permission: "High standards are caring. Letting someone fail slowly is not kindness."

**Short-term (30 days):**
1. Audit other long-tenured underperformers. This is probably not the only one.
2. Train managers on performance conversations - guilt is often just lack of skill
3. Update cultural language: "championship team" instead of "family"

**Ongoing:**
1. Establish clear performance expectations for every role
2. Regular performance reviews that actually address issues
3. Celebrate departures when necessary: "This wasn't the right fit, and that's okay"

### What This Does NOT Mean

You're not becoming heartless. You're becoming honest.

- The underperforming engineer deserves honesty about their standing
- Other employees deserve to work alongside high performers
- Managers deserve to manage without guilt
- "Taking care of your own" can mean helping someone find a role where they'll succeed

The kindest thing is often the hardest conversation.
